Hi&#128075;, I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in **C**omputer **S**cience at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
I am in the [Zhiyuan Honors Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/) of CS, also known as [**ACM Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), which targets at cultivating top computer scientists.

What differs me from my peer classmates is that I've grown an ineffaceable interest in Art, mainly in **music**&#9834; and **literature**&#128214;. 
I'd like to treat it more seriously and let it grow a bit bigger than hobbies. I have found myself saturated with the desire 
of expressing my views and thoughts to the world. But of course, the road ahead is long.

## Current Work

- I am doing researches on **T**heoretical **C**omputer **S**cience recently with [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com).
- My first electronic music piece is going to be released under [CEM Record](https://soundcloud.com/cemrecords) soon.

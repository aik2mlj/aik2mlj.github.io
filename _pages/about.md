Hi&#128075;, I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in **C**omputer **S**cience at _Shanghai Jiao Tong University_. 
I am in the _Zhiyuan Honor Program_ of CS, also known as **ACM Class**, which targets at cultivating top computer scientists.

What differs me from my peer classmates is that I've grown an ineffaceable interest in Art, mainly in **music**&#9834; and **literature**&#128214;. 
And I'd like to treat it more seriously and let it grow a bit bigger than hobbies. I have found myself saturated with the desire 
of expressing my views and thoughts. But of course, the road ahead is long.

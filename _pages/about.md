HiðŸ‘‹, I am Lejun, a researcher and young artist interested in **Computer Music**. Graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), I was formerly a member of [**ACM Honor Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program with extensive academic reputation. I will join MBZUAI as a full-time research assistant in Fall 2023, and begin my master's program at [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/), Stanford in Fall 2024!

My dream is to bring people closer to artistic creativity, with interdisciplinary research on music, media, and computer science. I am passionate about controllable music generation, music representation learning, machine improvisation, and human-computer interaction. My research interest can be aligned into two directions: 1. instilling creativity into machine learning models, especially for music generation; 2. provoking human creativity via interactive intelligent systems for music creation and improvisation.

As a versatile player, I can play [guzheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng) and piano, produce and mix electronic music, paint and design visual art, compose puerile poems written in Chinese calligraphy, [ollie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_(skateboarding)) over 2 skateboards, hold spiritual conversations on literature / philosophy, and make a good friend within 5 minutes.

## Selected Work

- Our work on controllable music generation with diffusion model has been accepted by **ISMIR 2023**! Check the publication page [here](/publications/polyffusion/).
- I did research on **T**heoretical **C**omputer **S**cience formerly with [Prof. Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com), SJTU.
- My first electronic music piece has been released under *CEM Records*, one of the most prestigious electronic music labels in China. Check it [here](/portfolio/sunset-sea/)!

HiðŸ‘‹, I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in **C**omputer **S**cience at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), a top-4 university in China. I am in the [Zhiyuan Honors Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/) of CS, also known as [**ACM Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), which targets at cultivating top computer scientists and researchers. Our program is famous for its remarkable alumna pushing forward the edges of various Computer Science domains, both in industry and academia.

Being competent among all the courses (ranking: 6/30), what differs me most from my peer classmates is that I've grown a keen interest in **ART**. I'd like to treat it more seriously and let it grow a bit bigger than hobbies. With a strong background in programming and mathematics, I believe I have the potential of instilling love and inspirations into relevant researches.

As a versatile player, I have probed into many areas apart from my major. I can play multiple instruments, sing pitch-perfectly, produce and mix my own music, compose puerile poems in Chinese calligraphy, [ollie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_(skateboarding)) over 2 skateboards, hold spiritual conversations on philosophy/religion, and make a good friend within 5min.

## Current Work

- I'm working on a deep music generation project with [Gus Xia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gxia/) at [Music X Lab](http://www.musicxlab.com), NYU Shanghai.
    - Our goal is to first accomplish a model for piano reduction from orchestra sheets, and then reverse the process -- generate orchestration from piano pieces. Both works utilize the power of deep learning (diffusion models, VAEs).
    - For that, I'm right now hired as a research assistant in [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi, UAE.
- I did researches on **T**heoretical **C**omputer **S**cience formerly with [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com), SJTU.
- My first electronic music piece has been released under *CEM Record*, one of the biggest electronic music labels in China. Check it [here](/portfolio/sunset_sea/)!

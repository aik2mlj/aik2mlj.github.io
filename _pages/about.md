HiðŸ‘‹, I am a senior undergraduate researcher interested in **Computer Music**. Majoring in **C**omputer **S**cience at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), I am a member of [**ACM Honor Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), an elite CS program with extensive academic reputation.

My dream is to bring people closer to artistic creativity, with interdisciplinary research on music, media, and computer science. I am passionate about music representation learning, controllable music generation, machine improvisation, and human-computer interaction. My research interest can be aligned into two directions: 1. instilling creativity into machine learning models, especially for music generation; 2. provoking human creativity via interactive intelligent systems for music creation and improvisation.

As a versatile player, I can play [guzheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng) and piano, produce and mix electronic music, paint and design visual art, compose puerile poems written in Chinese calligraphy, [ollie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_(skateboarding)) over 2 skateboards, hold spiritual conversations on literature / philosophy, and make a good friend within 5 minutes.

## Selected Work

- I'm working on a deep music generation project with [Prof. Gus Xia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gxia/) at [Music X Lab](http://www.musicxlab.com), NYU Shanghai.
    - We approach piano reduction and orchestration in the view of generative modeling with *Diffusion Models*. We devised an image-like piano-roll format for its training, and adopted cross-attention mechanics for symbolic music generation conditioned on chords and textures. Our model can generate and inpaint vivid and consistent music segments of arbitrary length. Some demos are provided [here](/publications/piano-roll-diffusion).
    - For that, I'm right now hired as a research assistant in [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), Abu Dhabi, UAE.
- I did research on **T**heoretical **C**omputer **S**cience formerly with [Prof. Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com), SJTU.
- My first electronic music piece has been released under *CEM Records*, one of the most prestigious electronic music labels in China. Check it [here](/portfolio/sunset-sea/)!

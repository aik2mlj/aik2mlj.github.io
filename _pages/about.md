HiðŸ‘‹, I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in **C**omputer **S**cience at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
I am in the [Zhiyuan Honors Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/) of CS, also known as [**ACM Class**](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), which targets at cultivating top computer scientists.

What differs me from my peer classmates is that I've grown an ineffaceable interest in Art, mainly in **music**â™ª and **literature**ðŸ“–. 
I'd like to treat it more seriously and let it grow a bit bigger than hobbies. I have found myself saturated with the desire 
of expressing my views and thoughts to the world. But of course, the road ahead is long.

## Current Work

- I'm working on a deep music generation project with [Gus Xia](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gxia/) at [Music X Lab](http://www.musicxlab.com), NYU Shanghai.
- I did researches on **T**heoretical **C**omputer **S**cience formerly with [Chihao Zhang](http://chihaozhang.com), SJTU.
- My first electronic music piece has been released under CEM Record. Check it on [NeteaseMusic](https://music.163.com/song?id=1904086661) or [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/cemrecords/aik2)!

_Installation with chairs, microphone, sound processing, loudspeaker_

On this staircase, scattered chairs assume postures of gathering and solitude — a quiet tableau of human presence without bodies. Each chair suggests a conversation paused, a relation suspended. A microphone placed among them listens to the ambient murmurs of the space — footsteps, breath, echoes — and feeds them through a live digital process that returns transformed sound to the far end of the stairs. The altered echoes mimic the way thoughts and identities reverberate within society: what we hear, we reshape, and what we reshape, we hear again. *Social Construct* reflects on how collective perception is built not from isolated truths but from feedback — a chorus of shifting voices inhabiting the same ascent.

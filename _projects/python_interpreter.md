As a course project for CS152, we designed an interpreter for a subset of the python language. `Antlr4` was used for syntax parsing. Apart from that, everything was handmade.

The tutorial repo is [here](https://github.com/ACMClassCourse-2021/Python-Assignment-2021). 
And my code is [here](https://github.com/aik2mlj/Python_Assignment).

This is a cooperated project including backend C++ coding, B+ Tree data structure implementation and frontend website design. It served as the course project for Data Structure course CS147.

With classmates Zeyu Xing and Zhenyu Xu, we together built a ready-to-use, efficiently-crafted and beautiful ticket system.
- I designed the major part of the C++ backend, which deals with ticket searching, booking and administration.
- Zeyu Xing designed the website frontend, and he also helped with code debugging.
- Zhengyu Xu implemented the B+ Tree, which is the core part of our database.

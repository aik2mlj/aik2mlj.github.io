collection: publications
permalink: /publication/piano-roll-diffusion
excerpt: 'Lejun Min, Gus Xia<br/>Our work utilizes conditional diffusion models on image‑like piano‑roll generation. By exploring means of conditional methods and guidances for diffusion models on music arrangement tasks, we combine inductive biases of intrinsic musical structure into diffusion‑based models.'

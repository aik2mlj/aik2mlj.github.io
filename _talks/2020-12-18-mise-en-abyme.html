<p>What is nesting? From the popular meme "No Nesting" to the literature allusion <i>Mise en abyme</i> raised by Andr√© Gide, 
I tried to deliver my understanding of the nesting behavior: why it evokes eerie feelings and, 
how it diverges from our everyday common sense yet happening profoundly everywhere in nature.</p>

<p>Then we took a look at how mathematicians utilize fractal as a tool of understanding nature, the incredible <i>Mandelbrot Set</i>, 
and why the total length of the coastline of England cannot be properly measured. A deeper dive of whether life could also be 
a nesting is closely examined afterwards. Given the famous <i>Conway's Game of Life</i> as a example, we inspected the meaning of 
nesting from a more philosophic perspective. The "observing chain": how we see images of ourselves when interacting with 
other people, how the concepts of "reality" and "being" taste like in the context of life progression. In the end we realized 
that this talk itself also served as a stage of nesting between the lecturer and the audiences.</p>

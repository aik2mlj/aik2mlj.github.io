A hand-on [tutorial](https://github.com/aik2mlj/raytracer-tutorial) of writing a Ray Tracer in Rust&#129408;. 
This is a project inherited from our seniors which aims at offering basic conceptions about CG and letting 
students take a sip of the Rust programming language.

We also added rust-relevant features like multi-thread rendering, static dispatch and code generation to help students 
develop a better understanding of how a compiler works. This year implementing `.obj` file support had become a game changer.
Here are some amazing art works created by our talented fellow students!

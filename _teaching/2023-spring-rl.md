I served as a teaching assistant for [Prof. Weinan Zhang](https://wnzhang.net/). The course includes comprehensive reinforcement learning lecturing and hands-on practices with assignments and a final project. I designed a wide range of project options: single- or multi-agent learning for simulated hands, objects, and physical legged robots.

The details of the course can be found [here](https://wnzhang.net/teaching/cs492/index.html).

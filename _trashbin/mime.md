I directed a peurile mime for the freshmen welcoming party. This was the first collaboration between newly-met classmates. We were honored to have our program director, Prof. Yong Yu, as one participant of the singing part.

This is a story about a CS student who faced obstacles in his life, study, and of course, relationship. He was then recovered thanks to the care and concern of his classmates and his advisor. The plots were very naively written, to be honest, but they represented our belief and prospect at that time. Because of our sincerity, this performance has to be one of the most memorable experience in college.
